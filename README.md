# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome!! This repository contains my ongoing project work and deliverables from the WriteTech Accelerator Program.

üöß **Note:** This portfolio is currently under development. I‚Äôll update it throughout the bootcamp and replace placeholder links with final project links as I make progress.

I‚Äôll be completing technical writing projects spanning various domains like API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation and Web3 during the course of the program using modern documentation workflows and tools.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me
I‚Äôm a Software engineer transitioning into Data Science, Machine Learning. I currently work as an Application Support Engineer heavily focused on Software testing, API Integration, software performance and monitoring, and improving technical documentation. I joined this accelerator program because I want to advance my technical writing skills and because of it's clear and structured learning coupled with my interest in being a technical writer in the core areas the Accelerator focuses on like APIs, DevOps, and Web3. This portfolio reflects my learning journey during the WriteTech Accelerator.
